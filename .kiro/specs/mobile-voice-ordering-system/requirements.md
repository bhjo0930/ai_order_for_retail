# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a mobile voice ordering system that integrates Google Cloud Speech-to-Text v2 streaming recognition with Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM. The system enables real-time voice and text-based ordering through an intelligent agent orchestrator that handles product search, coupon management, and order processing with mock payment functionality. The system supports both pickup and delivery order types and provides a seamless mobile user experience with synchronized UI updates.

## Requirements

1. WHEN a user searches for products THEN the system SHALL return relevant results with structured data
2. WHEN product names are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL present sorted candidate options
3. WHEN product details are requested THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive information including price, options, and availability
4. IF required slots (quantity, options) are missing THEN the system SHALL prompt for completion
5. WHEN products are selected THEN the system SHALL trigger cart updates with ui.update events
6. IF product search fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative suggestions and retry options

### Requirement 4: Coupon Management Agent

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to apply discount coupons to my order so that I can save money on my purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a coupon code is provided THEN the system SHALL validate its authenticity and applicability
2. WHEN calculating discounts THEN the system SHALL evaluate all conditions (minimum order, category restrictions, expiration)
3. WHEN applying coupons THEN the system SHALL handle exclusivity and stacking rules appropriately
4. IF a coupon is invalid THEN the system SHALL explain the reason and suggest alternatives
5. WHEN discount is applied THEN the system SHALL update cart totals immediately with ui.update events
6. WHEN multiple coupons conflict THEN the system SHALL apply the most beneficial combination for the customer

### Requirement 5: Order Processing Agent

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to complete my order with either pickup or delivery options so that I can receive my items in my preferred way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checkout begins THEN the system SHALL present cart summary for user confirmation
2. WHEN order type selection is required THEN the system SHALL offer pickup and delivery options clearly
3. IF pickup is selected THEN the system SHALL collect store location and pickup time preferences
4. IF delivery is selected THEN the system SHALL collect delivery address and calculate delivery fees
5. WHEN required information is complete THEN the system SHALL proceed to payment processing
6. WHEN order is confirmed THEN the system SHALL provide order tracking information and estimated completion time

### Requirement 6: Mock Payment Processing

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to complete payment for my order so that I can finalize my purchase, while the system maintains security by not handling real payment data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment is initiated THEN the system SHALL create a mock payment session without collecting sensitive payment information
2. WHEN payment processing begins THEN the system SHALL simulate payment status transitions (pending → success/failure)
3. IF payment simulation succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm the order and update order status
4. IF payment simulation fails THEN the system SHALL offer retry options or alternative payment methods
5. WHEN payment is complete THEN the system SHALL generate order confirmation with receipt details
6. WHEN payment processing occurs THEN the system SHALL never collect or store real payment credentials

### Requirement 7: State Management and UI Synchronization

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the mobile interface to stay synchronized with my actions so that I always see current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system state changes THEN the system SHALL emit appropriate ui.update events
2. WHEN transitioning between order states THEN the system SHALL follow the defined state machine (idle → intent_detected → slot_filling → cart_review → payment_session_created → payment_pending → paid/failed → post_order)
3. IF state transitions fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. WHEN UI updates are required THEN the system SHALL specify the target panel, view, and data payload
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable next steps
6. WHEN long operations are running THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 8: Multi-language and Accessibility Support

**User Story:** As a Korean-speaking customer, I want to interact with the system in my preferred language so that I can understand and use the service effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring speech recognition THEN the system SHALL support Korean (ko-KR) language settings
